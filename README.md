# Pokemon Battle Simulator React

A Pokemon battle sim project I've created using create-react-app following PWA guidelines. Right now its super basic but I plan on expanding it with more features as I learn more about React including:

- Fetching Pokemon from GraphQL instead of hard coding
- Better Styling
- Support for up to 6 on 6 battles with switching
- Status moves
- Damage and stat calculation like in the games
- Abilities
- And More
